Records EPL games by recording screen

Given a text file with links to a replay of an EPL game (from http://www.nbcsports.com/) this program will play each game in a broswer and record the screen. In order to do this, the program Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is needed (https://obsproject.com/). After the game is finished, the recording will be saved to file. Games that have already been recorded will not be recorded again.
